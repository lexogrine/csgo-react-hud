- no player dots design
- no observed player indicator on player sidebar
- no dead icon on radar
- no utility on radar
- no current round kills displayed on player bar
- when player is dead, only lower K or D number or icon on player bar is transparent
- no tech pause design

- for some reason texts are too bold if you compare it to design (eg.: HP in player bar, timer in scoreboard, utility level)
